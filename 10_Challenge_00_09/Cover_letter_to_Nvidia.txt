Dear NVIDIA Board of Directors,

I am writing to express my interest in the Chief Executive Officer position at NVIDIA. With extensive experience leading technology companies through periods of rapid innovation and market expansion, I have a proven record of setting strategic direction, building high-performing teams, and delivering sustained shareholder value. I bring deep familiarity with AI-driven product strategies, semiconductor and systems businesses, and an ability to align R&D, operations, and go-to-market functions to capitalize on market opportunities.

In prior leadership roles I have driven double-digit revenue growth, transformed organizational culture to prioritize engineering excellence and customer outcomes, and overseen large-scale partnerships and M&A that broadened product portfolios and accelerated time to market. I focus on clear vision, operational rigor, and an inclusive leadership style that empowers talent across the enterprise. I believe these strengths align with NVIDIA’s mission to lead the industry in accelerated computing and generative AI.

I am excited by NVIDIA’s technological leadership and growth trajectory and would welcome the opportunity to lead the company through its next phase. My target compensation for this role is an annual salary of $600,000, and I am open to discussing a total rewards package that aligns long-term incentives with company performance.


Sincerely,
[Your Name]
